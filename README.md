Building the Rock, paper, scissors project at :
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

The project is divided in 4 stages:
1. Get computer logic.
2. Get human choice.
3. Compare choices to play one round.
4. Extend to play 5 rounds and declare a winner.

All interaction will be through the browser's console (maybe later I will return and add full html and css )

Finished the assignment but the RNG still feels odd, maybe with another 
algorithm it can feel more "random".

Adding a UI and DOM manipulation

Again, commits will be divided in stages:

1. Change user choices from a prompt to 3 buttons.
2. Display results and scores to be displayed in divs
3. Change the hard coded 5 round game to a five game wins.

Also, this change is done in a different branch to see how it 
works.
