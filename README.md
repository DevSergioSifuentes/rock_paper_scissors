Building the Rock, paper, scissors project at :
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

The project is divided in 4 stages:
1. Get computer logic.
2. Get human choice.
3. Compare choices to play one round.
4. Extend to play 5 rounds and declare a winner.

All interaction will be through the browser's console (maybe later I will return and add full html and css )
